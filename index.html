        <p> Welcome to my online Professional Coding Portfolio!
            <br><p id="p2"> This page exists to showcase my works. Everything on the page includig the page itself, is coded and built by me. So feel free to have a look around and enjoy the cool applications!
                <br> Below you will find several of my latest coding projects. At the bottom of each pic, I've listed the various code languages and technology used to create them. That way, you can tell how it was made. Also a separate page for all of the 'source code' for each project. Please do not steal my code without crediting me for it's creation. I worked very hard on all of this. The code is mainly for employers to see that I worked on it myself, and for others if they wonder how I did it. Not for sale or anything. Thank You,
                <br><br> <div id="sig">Crystal Lynn m.</div>
